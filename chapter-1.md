# Chapter 1

Shelly the scallop and Shelldon the shrimp were the unlikeliest of couples. Shelly was known for her sophisticated pearl collection\fsd coral reef casino. Shelldon, on the other hand, was a bit of a goofball, always getting into scrapes with the grumpy crabs and losing his tiny spectacles. 

Their romance began, as most shellfish romances do, with a near-miss. Shelldon, in his usual clumsy fashion, bumped into Shelly during a high-stakes poker game. He spilled a mountain of seaweed chips all over her elegant pearls.
