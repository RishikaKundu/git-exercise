# Shelldon and Sally

Shay the scallop and Shelldon the shrimp were the unlikeliest of couples. Shay was known for her sophisticated pearl collection\fsd and quiet evenings at the coral reef casino. Shelldon, on the other hand, was a bit of a goofball, always getting into scrapes with the grumpy crabs and losing his tiny spectacles. 

Their romance began, as most shellfish romances do, with a near-miss. Shelldon, in his usual clumsy fashion, bumped into Shay during a high-stakes poker game. He spilled a mountain of seaweed chips all over her elegant pearls.
